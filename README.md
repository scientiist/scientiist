Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a hobbyist and freelance programmer with a keen interest in computer graphics, physics, mathematics, game engines, and other scientific disciplines. I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, and I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new concepts and technologies.

ðŸ”­ What I'm Currently Working On

I'm currently porting my old JUI Toolkit (Josh's User Interface) to C++ & SDL2. I previously developed it for Lua/Love2D, then ported it to C#/MonoGame.


ðŸŒ± What I'm Currently Learning

I'm always expanding my knowledge and exploring new areas. Currently, I'm focused on:

    Advancing my understanding of computer graphics techniques, including shaders, rendering algorithms, and real-time simulations.
    Deepening my knowledge of physics principles and how they can be applied to interactive systems and simulations.
    Exploring advanced mathematics concepts, such as linear algebra, calculus, and numerical methods, to improve my problem-solving abilities.
    Expanding my expertise in game engine development, studying different architectures and exploring optimization techniques.
    Continuing my journey with RedHat/Fedora Linux, honing my skills in system administration and troubleshooting.
